#AirBnB_Console

This is a Team project, to build a clone of AirBnB. It is my first step towards building a full web application: AirBnB clone. 
This first step is very important because it will be used to execute other projects like; HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration etc.,

The first stage is to build a Console. 
The console is a command interpreter to manage objects' abstraction between objects and how they are stored.
To see the fundamental background of the project visit the Wiki.

The console will perform the following tasks:

Create a new object.
Retrieve an object from a file.
Do operations on objects.
Destroy an object.
