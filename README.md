This is a Team project, to build a clone of [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/). 
The project is in phases. This phase is the first step towards building a full web application: AirBnB clone. 
This phase is very important for an aspiring full-stack engineer because it will be used to execute other projects like; HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration etc.,

Phase 1 which is the first stage 1 project is to build a Console. 
The console is a command interpreter to manage objects' abstraction between objects and how they are stored.
To see the fundamental background of the project visit the [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb).

The console will perform the following tasks:

Create a new object.
Retrieve an object from a file.
Do operations on objects.
Destroy an object.
### Storage
All the classes are handled by the <span style="background-color:grey">Storage</span> engine in the <span style="background-color:grey">FileStorage</span> Class.
